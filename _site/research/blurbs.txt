I am a cognitive neuroscientist focused on understanding how children learn and the disabilities that may interfere with their educational goals. I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the [Brain and Mind Institute](https://www.uwo.ca/bmi/) at Western University, working with [Daniel Ansari](https://www.edu.uwo.ca/faculty-profiles/daniel-ansari.html) alongside a wonderful group of scientists in the [Numerical Cognition Lab](https://www.edu.uwo.ca/faculty-profiles/daniel-ansari.html).

Before I moved to Canada, I completed my PhD in Neuroscience with [Gavin Price](https://www.numericalbrainlab.com/people) at Vanderbilt University and an M.Ed. at Harvard University.

My research is mostly focused on the development of mathematical skills and the neurocognitive mechanisms that enable this type of cognition. For example, sometimes this means I am collaborating with intervention specialists to do school-based research about who and why some children are struggling. Other times, this means that I am running a neuroimaging experiment with typically developing adults to understand the basic science of how a specific brain mechanism works. I also used techniques such as eye-tracking, structural brain imaging, and meta-analysis.

Ultimately, my aim is conduct developmental neuroscience research that is informed by cognitive and educational theory and has the ability to give back to this theory. By enriching our understanding of what learning disabilities look like neurobiologically, we may further understand how to identify learning difficulties and identify targets for remediation via interventions. Building on this research, I hope inform education policy and practice. I get excited about science communication and community engagement to this end.
