	<p>I am a cognitive neuroscientist focused on understanding how children learn and how disabilities may interfere with their educational goals. Currently, I am a postdoctoral scholar at the <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/bmi/">Brain and Mind Institute</a> at Western University, working with <a href="https://www.edu.uwo.ca/faculty-profiles/daniel-ansari.html">Daniel Ansari</a> alongside a wonderful group of scientists in the <a href="https://www.edu.uwo.ca/faculty-profiles/daniel-ansari.html">Numerical Cognition Lab</a>.</p>

<div class="gap-10"></div>

	<p>Before I moved to Canada, I completed my PhD in Neuroscience with <a href="https://www.numericalbrainlab.com/people">Gavin Price</a> at Vanderbilt University, and an M.Ed. at Harvard University.</p>

<div class="gap-10"></div>

	<p>My research primarily focuses on the development of mathematical skills and the neurocognitive mechanisms that enable this type of cognition. Sometimes this means I am collaborating with intervention specialists to do school-based research about why some children are struggling to learn. Other times, this means that I am running a neuroimaging experiment with typically developing adults to understand the basic science of how a specific brain mechanism works. I also use techniques such as eye-tracking, structural brain imaging, and meta-analysis of behavioral and neuro-imaging data.</p>
