	<p>I am a cognitive neuroscientist focused on understanding how children learn and how disabilities may interfere with their educational goals. Currently, I am a postdoctoral scholar at the <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/bmi/">Brain and Mind Institute</a> at Western University, working with <a href="https://www.edu.uwo.ca/faculty-profiles/daniel-ansari.html">Daniel Ansari</a> alongside a wonderful group of scientists in the <a href="https://www.edu.uwo.ca/faculty-profiles/daniel-ansari.html">Numerical Cognition Lab</a>.</p>

	<p>Before I moved to Canada, I completed my PhD in Neuroscience with <a href="https://www.numericalbrainlab.com/people">Gavin Price</a> at Vanderbilt University, and an M.Ed. at Harvard University.</p>

	<p>My research primarily focuses on the development of mathematical skills and the neurocognitive mechanisms that enable this type of cognition. Sometimes this means I am collaborating with intervention specialists to do school-based research about why some children are struggling to learn. Other times, this means that I am running a neuroimaging experiment with typically developing adults to understand the basic science of how a specific brain mechanism works. I also use techniques such as eye-tracking, structural brain imaging, and meta-analysis of behavioral and neuro-imaging data.</p>

<div class="gap-10"></div>

	<p>Ultimately, my aim is to conduct developmental neuroscience research that is informed by cognitive and educational theory and has the ability to give back to this theory. By enriching our understanding of what learning disabilities look like neurobiologically, we may further understand how to identify learning difficulties and identify targets for remediation via interventions. Building on this research, I hope inform education policy and practice. I get excited about science communication and community engagement to this end. This webpage is a place to collect my research and connect with others who share similar goals.</p>
