	<p>I am a cognitive neuroscientist focused on understanding how children learn and how disabilities may interfere with their educational goals. Currently, I'm an Assistant Professor in Psychology & Human Development at Vanderbilt University working in the area of Educational Neuroscience.

	<p>My research primarily focuses on the development of mathematical skills and the neurocognitive mechanisms that enable this type of cognition. Sometimes this means I am collaborating with intervention specialists to do school-based research about why some children are struggling to learn. Other times, this means that I am running a neuroimaging experiment with typically developing adults to understand the basic science of how a specific brain mechanism works. I also use techniques such as eye-tracking, structural brain imaging, and meta-analysis of behavioral and neuro-imaging data.</p>
