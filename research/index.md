### Attention to Number
> My dissertation research focused on the integration of attention systems in the brain with numerical magnitude processing mechanisms. In a series of three studies, this work demonstrates that attention is an important mechanism to consider in how numerical perception relates to math ability, both for typically developing children and for those with math difficulties. I look forward to integrating these new findings with existing models of numerical cognition.

### Executive Function and Math
> Little is known about how representation of number and mathematical knowledge works with with the neural mechanisms of executive function (working memory, inhibitory control, and rule switching). But, based on the behavioral literature, we do know that this link is very important! Some of my current work using ultra-high field fMRI focuses on understanding the integration of these networks.

### Math Learning Difficulties and Developmental Dyscalculia
> An estimated 3-6% of the population is affected by the specific mathematics learning disability developmental dyscalculia (DD). Individuals with DD display difficulties with fundamental aspects of numerical processing from very early ages and continue to struggle with math, even when given the same schooling opportunities as their peers. A further 10-20% of the population have so much trouble with math that it impairs their ability to use information effectively in adult life. However, the nature of these numerical deficits and their relation to the abilities of typically developing populations remains poorly understood. By understanding the neurocognitive roots of math difficulties, I hope to do research that informs pedagogical techniques for struggling learners, diagnosis of learning disabilities, and remediation of math deficits.

### Ultra-high field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
> One of the neuroimaging advances that Iâ€™m excited about is ultra-high field strengths. Both my PhD institution, Vanderbilt, and my postdoc institution, Western, have 7 Tesla MRI magnets. The use of such high field strengths for research in functional imaging has led to increased data quality and some really neat neuroimaging techniques.

### Open Science
> I'm relatively new to open science. If you are too, [here are some resources](https://opensciencemooc.eu/). That said, I'm quickly learning that it will be an important part of my research going forward. In essence it is just a way of practicing science that prioritizes transparency in research (_which makes for good science_) and openness in dissemination (_which creates science for the common good_). It also facilitates collaboration amongst colleagues.
